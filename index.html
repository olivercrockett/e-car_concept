    <div id="one">
      <h2>The Concept Car</h2>
      <p>Our all new electric sports car is among the first to enter the market and is set to revolutionise it. Priced at around £20,000 it will be the most cost 
        effective on the market and without compromise of quality. Sometimes, less is more and this is one of them. Thanks to innovative, new solutions this is one 
        of the most mechanically effective cars you could buy and without unnecessary weight, comes speed. Lots of it.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="two">
      <h3>In-Wheel Electric Motors</h3>
      <p>A pair of In-Wheel motors massively reduce mechanical complexity, making the car lighter, faster and more efficient (as well as more cost effective). 
        These motors will provide a total of 215hp to the rear wheels, giving the car a huge 280hp per ton, as well as regenerative braking and advanced ESP and TC.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="three">
      <h3>Priced at £20,000</h3>
      <p>This unheard of price is achieved not by faltering in quality, but by finding innovative methods to reduce mechanical complexity. 
        Sometimes less is more.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="four">
      <h3>Speed!</h3>
      <p>With a 0-60mph time of 2.7 seconds, and a top speed of over 140mph, this car has unheard of speed for its price range, thanks to its innovative technologies. 
        Its low centre of mass will give it excellent handling, to make it just as fast through the corners.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="five">
      <h3>Innovative Brakes</h3>
      <p>The front brakes use an all new, in wheel drum system that has been found to stay 40% cooler than traditional discs as well as providing more braking power. 
        This will also be supplemented by the regenerative braking in the rear wheels.</p>
